The course is designed to prepare qualified students for the High School Calculus course in their senior year. The course will cover a blend of topics from Algebra 2 and Precalculus, with a focus on the basic foundational knowledge for success in Calculus. Students taking Accelerated Algebra 2 have two advancement options - Calculus and Precalculus. Precalculus Honors and Calculus AB AP are not advancement options. Please note that a student must earn a B- or better in Accelerated Algebra 2 in order to qualify for Calculus as a senior, or a C- or better to qualify for Precalculus.

This course is equivalent to the first semester and a half of a college level (algebra-based) physics course (typically taken in college by biology, pre-medicine, biochemistry, and other life-science majors). This course is designed for the student who is superior in both ability and motivation in the scientific area and who desires a strong scientific challenge. Students are encouraged to take the AP Physics 1 Exam. Students must first complete Biology and Chemistry. Students must also be concurrently enrolled in at least PreCalculus Honors. If the student is concurrently enrolled in PreCalculus Honors, a trigonometry review is strongly suggested.Teacher: StaffCourse Content: AP Physics 1 is a one-year algebra-based physics course. Topics covered in the class include the most important topics on the Physics AP-1 exam: Kinematics, Newton's laws with gravity and circular motion, work, power and momentum, torque and rotational motion, simple harmonic motion with sound and waves, and electricity.

The fundamental perspective of this course is that the moral life is an invitation to all persons to fulfill their human destiny in response to the gratuitous love of God. For Catholic Christians, the moral life is life in Jesus Christ, which is characterized by our loving one another as Jesus loved us. The nature of truth and goodness, development of moral character, formation of personal conscience, spiritual discernment in the Ignatian tradition, and criteria for judgment and action will be explored. Contemporary moral issues relating to consumer culture, human sexuality, alcohol and other drugs, technology and mass society, abortion, euthanasia, and the death penalty will be discussed.

It is based on the gritty hard-boiled detective stories of the 1930s, and is closely linked to a number of films and television programs that are still being made to this day. We will begin by learning about the origins of cyberpunk culture, the Rave scene, and cyberpunk literature and cinema, finding important links with the hippies of the 1960s and the Beat Generation of the 1950s. We will examine William Gibson's Neuromancer, the first cyberpunk novel ever written, which essentially predicts the existence of cyberspace and the internet. We will also explore the cinema of the period, taking a look at Blade Runner, the cult-favorite film directed by the legendary Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, fresh from his Han Solo fame.

The fundamental perspective of this course is rooted in revelation of the prophetic Word of God: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts! All the earth is filled with God's glory!(Isaiah 6:3). This course on spirituality and nature is based on biblical texts, the faith and tradition of Catholic Church, wisdom from religious traditions and philosophy, and the words and actions of saints and heroes of the environment, for example, St. Francis of Assisi, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Contemporary social issues relating to environmental stewardship, wilderness preservation, conservation, exploitation, pollution, and destruction will be addressed from perspectives of Catholic social teaching.
