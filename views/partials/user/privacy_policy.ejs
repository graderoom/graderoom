                            know
                            that information in order to process it on Graderoom's behalf or to provide services

                            at Graderoom's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
                            by using Graderoom's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
                            Graderoom
                            will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying

                            described
                            above, Graderoom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                            information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
                            when
                            Graderoom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
                            property

                            primarily use our changelog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
                            this

                        <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
                        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
                            services
                            to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any
                            person
                            or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
                            collecting
                            PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                            exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is
                            being
                            shared. – See more at:

                        <h4>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h4>
                        <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>

                        <p>Once this privacy policy is created we will add a link to it on our home page or as a
                            minimum, on
                            the first significant page after entering our website.
                        </p>

                        <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word "privacy" and can be easily found on the page
                            specified
                            above.

                        <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
                        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
                            years
                            old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
                            Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
                            children’s privacy and safety online.
                        </p>

                        <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

                        <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
                        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United
                            States
                            and
                            the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
                            protection
                            laws
                            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should
                            be
                            implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
                            information.
                        </p>

                        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
                            action,
                            should a data breach occur:
                        </p>

                        <p>We will notify you via email within seven business days.</p>

                        <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the
                            right
                            to
                            legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
                            to
                            the
                            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
                            users,
                            but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
                            and/or
                            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                        </p>

                        <h3>CAN-SPAM Act</h3>
                        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
                            for
                            commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
                            them,
                            and
                            spells out tough penalties for violations.
                        </p>

                        <p>We collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries, and/or
