                        <p>It is Graderoom's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
                            while
                            operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://beta.graderoom.me">https://beta.graderoom.me</a>
                            (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://beta.graderoom.me"). We respect your privacy and are
                            committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
                            Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information
                            may
                            be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we
                            may
                            disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information
                            we
                            collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                        general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
                        visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Graderoom collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Graderoom's purpose
                        in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Graderoom's
                        visitors use its website. From time to time, Graderoom may release non-personally-identifying
                        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                        website.</p>
                    <p>Graderoom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://beta.graderoom.me
                        blog posts. Graderoom only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described
                        below.</p>

                    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                    <p>Certain visitors to Graderoom choose to interact with Graderoom in ways that require
                        Graderoom to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                        Graderoom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>

                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
                        its absolute security.</p>


                    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                    <p>Graderoom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                        only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
                        that information in order to process it on Graderoom's behalf or to provide services available
                        at Graderoom's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
                        by using Graderoom's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Graderoom
                        will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                        to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
                        above, Graderoom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                        information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when
                        Graderoom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
                        or rights of Graderoom, third parties or the public at large.</p>
                    <p>If you are a registered user of https://beta.graderoom.me and have supplied your email address,
                        Graderoom may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
                        feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Graderoom. We
                        primarily use our changelog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
                        type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
                        of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
                        respond to your request or to help us support other users. Graderoom takes all measures
                        reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
                        of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                    <p>Graderoom may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Graderoom may
                        display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Graderoom does not disclose
                        your personally-identifying information.</p>


                    <h2>Cookies</h2>

                        your preferences on your computer.</p>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the

                        to help Graderoom identify and track visitors, their usage of https://beta.graderoom.me, and
                        their website access preferences. Graderoom visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
                        their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Graderoom's websites,
                        with the drawback that certain features of Graderoom's websites may not function properly

                    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Graderoom may change its Privacy Policy from time
                        to time, and in Graderoom's sole discretion. Graderoom encourages visitors to frequently check
