The course is well-balanced between procedural fluency (algorithms and basic skills), deep conceptual understanding, strategic competence (problem-solving), and adaptive reasoning (extension and transference). On a daily basis, students use problem-solving strategies, questioning, investigating, analyzing critically, gathering and constructing evidence, and communicating rigorous arguments justifying their thinking.

Topics include: Stacks and queues, recursion, lists, dynamic arrays, binary search trees, iteration over collections, hashing, searching, elementary sorting and Big-O notation. The course covers the equivalent of two semesters of university level computer science for engineering majors. Introductory topics will be covered only briefly, allowing time for study of more advanced material. There will be several substantial projects each semester. The primary programming language will be Java with an introduction to C++ towards the end of the spring semester. </p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed January 2023)</p></div>

With Bellarmine's diverse population in mind, this course will challenge students to examine themselves through the study of African American Literature. Former California Poet Laureate Al Young states it another way: "You may think you are reading and thinking about African American literature, but, in reality, it is America herself you will be exploring and experiencing through literature." This course will examine the history and culture of African Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries, beginning with slave narratives. The course will progress through the genres of poetry, short story, drama and novels. Our study will also take us to African American cultural manifestations in speech, art, film, and music. Time will also be spent on August Wilson's dramatic vision and the blues as cultural artifact.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

A non-verbal atmosphere may cause some initial stress or anxiety. Overcoming this anxiety, feel free to make mistakes and learn from them and supporting those around you to do the same is another goal I have for students in my class.

The class will continue to focus on vocabulary expansion, idioms, manual and non-manual aspects of ASL, ASL linguistics, cross cultural communication, and cultural knowledge at an advanced level. It expands upon complex grammatical, lexical structures.  It is designed to prefect your receptive and expressive language skills so that you would feel comfortable in a Deaf Community setting. Material covered in class will provide linguistic principles of American Sign Language at the advanced level and grammatical structures for complex sentences. ASL expressive presentations are performed in small groups and on an individual basis. An increased focus is on the improvement of a student's ability to express him/herself using ASL. Conducted in ASL, students in this advanced language course refine their language skills and enhance their vocabulary acquisition.  </p><p>ASL Zone:  Since ASL is a visual/gestural language you will need to develop communication skills of which you are not accustomed: using one's hands, face, body, eyes and space. In order to progress, it is important that students become comfortable using their bodies and "listening" with their eyes. To encourage and foster the development of these skills, voicing in the classroom will be avoided as much as possible. During and at the end of each class session, feel free to sign or write your questions on the whiteboard to get clarification on ASL grammar or what was covered in class that evening for the benefit of the class.  You will be allowed to use your voice to give pertinent announcements to the class such as potential community class events upon instructor permission. </p><p><br></p><p>Pending UC/CSU approval</p><p>Reviewed December 2023</p></div>

Students develop 2-D skills through materials and processes of their choosing, such as graphic design, digital art, photography, drawing &amp; painting, and others. At the beginning of the year, students will develop their own inquiry question relating to concept and/or process and spend the rest of the year producing pieces that visually respond to this question that may change over time. Students will use sketchbooks to document their creative process from ideation to final product as they produce 5-7 major artworks and 5-7 minor artworks. Students will be expected to adhere to a production schedule punctuated with work-in-progress critiques during the investigation as well as final critiques at the end of each investigation--the goal of critiques being self-reflection, revision, and experiencing the fruitful co-influencing that happens in artistic communities. Students will also receive guidance in selecting and preparing 15 images for their Sustained Investigation portion and five images for their Selected Works portion of the AP Portfolio submission.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Updated September 2023)</p></div>

Students will practice spoken and written Chinese in complex communicative activities, using practice sessions to fine-tune pronunciation, expand vocabulary, and internalize more complex grammatical constructions. Extensive speaking assignments on various topics, reading of authentic texts and writing in different genres and registers are required. They will also develop a more in-depth understanding of Chinese culture through projects and field trips. This course will be conducted primarily in Chinese.

This African American literature elective for seniors will explore four plays from Wilson's Century Cycle which chronicles the experiences of African Americans in each decade of the twentieth century. Students will examine the historical context of each play, blues music, family relations and the American Dream, African ritual, African American Legacy, poetry, and art; in Wilson's hands, these elements come alive to celebrate Black culture through American dramatic literature. We will study four of Wilson's works: Gem of the Ocean (1904), Joe Turner's Come and Gone (1911), Fences (1957), Radio Golf (1997). We may also attend a performance by one of the Bay Area's African American theater companies.</p><p><br></p><p>UC/CSU Approved Course</p><p>(Revised January 2023)</p></div>

Content is divided into nine units that extend beyond topics taught in CP Chemistry or Chemistry Honors. This is a lab-intensive course with a focus on inquiry, analysis, and lab technique. Both the difficulty and volume of material covered in this course will require considerable dedication from each student. This course is designed to: 1) further his knowledge of chemistry; 2) increase his laboratory skills and 3) prepare the student for the Chemistry AP exam. An AP Chemistry student should be an independent, self-motivated learner with strong analytical reasoning ability. He must have a strong interest in chemistry and performed well in his introductory chemistry course.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/ CSU/ NCAA approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

This course examines the human experience of the moral life. The course examines the human experience of the moral life. The focus of this class is the Roman Catholic moral theological tradition even while examining ethical insights from a variety of philosophical, religious and cultural traditions. The fundamental perspective of this course is that Christian Ethics is an invitation to follow the way of Christ; that all persons fulfill their human destiny in response to the gratuitous love of God characterized by our loving one another as our neighbor. The class explores themes of truth and goodness, development of moral character, formation of personal conscience, spiritual discernment in the Ignatian tradition, criteria for judgment and action, and counter-cultural exemplars of servant and moral leadership. This course should be seen in direct relation to next semester's required Religious Studies course, Social Justice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>*UC/CSU approved course</strong></p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Christian Scriptures employs Historical-Contextual methods of Biblical study to introduce the students to the Gospels. The students use these modern tools of Biblical criticism to analyze each Gospel's unique audience, themes, and understandings of Jesus. Besides paying special attention to material that is specific to each Gospel, the students will identify and assess the themes common to all the Gospels: the ways Jesus interacted with, and was impacted by, the dominant groups and sociological realities of first century Palestine; Jesus' preeminent concern for the Kingdom of God; Jesus' teachings and acts of mercy; the Passion of Jesus Christ; the Resurrection and call to discipleship. Building off the theme of discipleship, the students will asses how Catholic Social Teaching connects to modern instances of injustice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>*UC/CSU approved course</strong></p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Historical, economic, political, and especially cultural perspectives will be applied to theory and case studies to better understand why the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been plagued with so many wars, revolutions, uprisings, and violent movements. Case studies will focus on South East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Specific cases will include Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Israel/Palestine, and Rwanda. Instruction will be primarily lecture and discussion of readings. Assessment will take the form of teacher and self-generated portfolio style homework assignments, one research project that will culminate in an oral presentation, and an all essay midterm and final. Students will need strong research and note-taking skills, and an interest in history, culture, and social justice issues. </p><p><br></p><p>*UC/ CSU/ NCAA approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p><p><br></p></div>

Literature of the Counterculture is a journey into the minds of some revolutionary thinkers and a study of the Beat Generation. We will critique our society as well as discover ways to be just and compassionate stewards of our own world. In addition to the aforementioned authors, the works of Amiri Baraka, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lew Welch, Gregory Corso, and others will be read, performed, and discussed in order to gain a better understanding of these subcultures. Further, we will examine the musical form of Bebop jazz pioneered by artists like Charlie "Bird" Parker, Dizzie Gillespe, and Miles Davis. In regard to creative endeavors, we will experiment with spontaneous prose composition, created by Jack Kerouac, and we will study the California Assemblage movement and create our own bizarre but socially relevant sculptures. Lastly, we will view and discuss some groundbreaking experimental films by Beat magicians of the genre.

The course explores the human movement beyond oneself toward connection with each other, God, and the global community. Students will study diverse community and assess issues of justice and injustice from the standpoint of personal ethics and responsibility to the community. Ultimately, the course is an opportunity for students to inspect and articulate their own beliefs, then to apply those beliefs to real-world issues, locally adn globally. Students will utilize philosophical inquiry, reflection on narrative, and study of the history and tradition of the Catholic Church in approaching these questions.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Tag along with Major Kusanagi, a futuristic cyborg who works for Japanese intelligence and is trying to bring down the most dangerous cyberterrorist in the world! Cyberpunk Literature is a genre of science fiction that began in the early 1980s, and is always set in the near future. It is based on the gritty hard-boiled detective stories of the 1930s, and is closely linked to a number of films and television programs that are still being made to this day. We will begin by learning about the origins of cyberpunk culture, the Rave scene, and cyberpunk literature and cinema, finding important links with the hippies of the 1960s and the Beat Generation of the 1950s. We will examine William Gibson's Neuromancer, the first cyberpunk novel ever written, which essentially predicts the existence of cyberspace and the internet. We will also explore the cinema of the period, taking a look at Blade Runner, the cult-favorite film directed by the legendary Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, fresh from his Han Solo fame. Because Japanese culture had a tremendous impact in the visionary future of the 1980s, we will trace the rise of Anime and Manga in America, including the landmark releases of Akira and Ghost in the Shell in the United States in the '90s. We will study the graphic novel, including The Dark Knight Returns, which reboots the Batman story in a very unexpected way, and Watchmen, a superhero mystery set in an alternative future. We will take a foray into the alternative Afrofuturist Movement which envisions a multicultural future in space, and includes such musical legends as Sun Ra, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic.</p><p>* UC/CSU approved</p></div>

In reading and writing about characters and communities representing different voices, students will explore how to navigate their own identity and combat injustice. Ultimately, students will come to an affirmation of themselves and understand and celebrate diversity. Using their analysis of literature, students will begin by focusing on the basis of argumentation; writing four one paragraph essays in the first semester. During the second semester, each student will write two five-paragraph essays, introducing them to the structure that will serve as the basis of their writing throughout their Bellarmine English education.</p><p><br></p><p>UC/CSU approved course</p><p>Revised September 2023</p></div>

<p>
	Course Content:&nbsp; English II Honors is an accelerated course in which self-motivated students are challenged to read, discuss, and come to an in-depth understanding of numerous full length literary works and a large number of additional essays, stories and poems from the American literary canon. Each student will be required to demonstrate his understanding of these works through a variety of written and oral assignments. As a survey of American Literature, the course proposes to link the themes and characters of our national literature to the historical periods from which they evolve and are influenced. All four primary genres of literature are included in this coverage. This course uses a vocabulary syllabus similar to other sophomore classes, and in the area of composition, teaches the expository paper as well as the research paper. A seminar format is employed. This course is for students with a great interest in reading and in the exploration of literature.</p>

The class is divided into three sections. 1) Discovering your own voice and learning to write stories about your life. 2) Character voice: learning how to create a character and mimic other authors' voices. 3) Story Mechanics: the fundamentals of writing including plot, theme, character, description, dialogue, perspective, conflict, syntax, word choice, symbolism, and ultimately style. In order to accomplish these goals, the class will use open ended journaling as well as brainstorming activities to draw on a student's own life experiences for story material. We will also study and model the writings of master story tellers including William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, C.S. Lewis, Edgar Allan Poe, Bernard Malamud, Flannery O'Connor, and John Updike, among others, in order to incorporate their techniques into original stories. Peer evaluations and public readings will also be used to understand criticism and how to incorporate criticism to better students' writing.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Through the reading of essay, short stories, journals, poems and novels, students will gain an understanding of the almost incomprehensible events known as the Final Solution. The class will examine tremendous acts of heroism and horrendous acts of evil, and in the process, consider morality, racism, prejudice, apathy, and obedience to authority. By studying how victims of the Holocaust dealt with deprivation, terror, and death, students will gain insights into a significant historical period, the dark side of human nature, and the enormous power of the human spirit in times of incredible despair.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Each thematic unit deals with one aspect of the spirituality of Ignatian decision-making, applying these tools to the real choices faced by seniors and college students. Each section of the course will consist of reading articles and excerpts from scholarly sources, watching a popular film that illustrates the articles, and writing a paper that synthesizes 1) the articles, 2) the film, and 3) the student's own life experiences.

Today, more than ever, we are bombarded with countless post-apocalyptic films, TV shows, and video games. Political and environmental activists warn with increasing fervor the potential for extinction through nuclear annihilation or climate change. Constantly, we are asked to imagine various scenarios for human extinction--climate catastrophe, nuclear annihilation, alien invasions, zombie infestations, disease outbreaks, robot uprisings, human infertility, and more. The driving question of this course is why have we become so obsessed with the apocalypse? What does this anxiety with our extinction reveal about our society today? We will use this genre about the end of the world to explore fundamental philosophical questions about human existence in the modern world: the dangers of science and progress, the problem of evil, the legitimate forms of political and moral authority, and ultimately, what it means to be human and have purpose in one's life.</p><p><br></p><p> UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Students will explore concepts of physics including Newtonian mechanics, work, energy, and power, mechanical waves and sound; and introductory electricity with circuits through an inquiry-based curriculum. The course is rich in hands-on activities that include a combination of lab experiments, design challenges, engineering projects, computer simulations, while building on curiosity and a scientific community through collaborative learning, demonstrations, and lectures. Course content is aligned to the fundamental principles of Algebra I. Laboratory work, in conjunction with the appropriate mathematical and conceptual reasoning, is an important component used to aid the students understanding of the physical world.</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/ CSU/ NCAA approved course</p><p>(Revised September 2023)</p></div>

This course is designed to be the equivalent of a first-year calculus-based physics course that is typically taken in college by students majoring in the physical sciences or engineering. Students are required to take the two AP Physics C exams: 1) Mechanics and 2) Electricity &amp; Magnetism. Like the AP Physics 1 course, Physics C AP is designed for the student who is superior in both ability and motivation in the scientific area. However, this course requires students to be more self-sufficient than students in the Physics 1 course, and the level of study, discussion, assigned problems, classroom presentations, and labs/projects is more complex.</p><p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Staff</p><p><strong>Course Content:</strong> Physics C: Mechanics and Electricity &amp; Magnetism AP is a one-year calculus-based physics course. Mechanics topics covered include: One and two-dimensional Kinematics; Kinetics (Newton's Laws of Motion); Work-Energy; Impulse-Momentum; and Rotational Kinematics, Kinetics, Energy, and Momentum. Electricity &amp; Magnetism topics covered include: Electrostatics, Capacitor and Dielectrics, Electrical Circuits, Magnetic Fields including the Biot-Savart law, and Electromagnetism with an emphasis on Maxwell's Equations..</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/ CSU/ NCAA approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

It should be seen in direct relation to the previous semester's required religious studies course for juniors, Christian Ethics. The fundamental perspective of this course in social justice is the recognition that the human person is made in the image of God and endowed with dignity, which is manifest in community with others. The foundation of the course is informed by faith in Jesus Christ, biblical ideals of justice and righteousness, and the Catholic moral tradition. Catholic Social Teaching - the moral teaching of the Catholic Church on social, economic, political, cultural, and religious issues - is given special consideration throughout the semester. The following contemporary issues are among those examined during the semester: ideals of justice, human rights, poverty amid wealth, hunger, racism, sexism, violence, war and peace, issues in political economy such as international trade, and environmental stewardship. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>UC/CSU approved course</strong></p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>

Our understanding of justice and heroism, as well as our culture's obsession with violence, come from our narratives about the Wild West. In this course, we will start by analyzing classic Western films to see the origin of America's foundational myth. Then, we will study more contemporary neo-Westerns to see how directors have complicated those foundational values. Finally, we will investigate Western novels, climaxing with Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, to see how contemporary authors have deconstructed the genre.</p><p>Ultimately, by studying the Wild West, this course will explore not only the development the America's core values but also the universal human need for grand narratives and myths to understand our place in the world.

If you haven't had that experience this class is definitely for you. Theology, Spirituality and Nature is an elective one-semester course in religious studies for seniors. This course examines the human experience of awe and wonder when encountering the mystery of life in nature. This class focuses on Roman Catholic theological and spiritual traditions while examining other spiritual and philosophical experiences of transcendence through encounters in nature. The fundamental perspective of this course is rooted in revelation of the prophetic Word of God: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts! All the earth is filled with God's glory!(Isaiah 6:3). This course on spirituality and nature is based on biblical texts, the faith and tradition of Catholic Church, wisdom from religious traditions and philosophy, and the words and actions of saints and heroes of the environment, for example, St. Francis of Assisi, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Contemporary social issues relating to environmental stewardship, wilderness preservation, conservation, exploitation, pollution, and destruction will be addressed from perspectives of Catholic social teaching. A central dimension of this course depends upon student encounters with creation and nature followed by reflection on those experiences. </p><p><br></p><p> *UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Revised September 2023)</p></div>

However, so often the voices from oppressed ethnic communities are suppressed and unheard in terms of their struggles and how it has shaped their spiritual journeys. This course aims to build in students a sense of solidarity with these oppressed communities and build their responsibility to be allies of the oppressed in working for liberation and the building of the Kingdom of God. This course will attempt to draw students into an analysis of spiritualities/theologies arising from varying oppressed ethnic communities including the African American Experience, Latin American Experience, and Asian American Experience (includes Chinese American, Filipino American, Japanese American, Korean American, South East Asian, and Vietnamese American). The intent is to lift these voices from the underside creating a better understanding of faith in action. Envisioned are students who leave this course more truly committed to being for and with others(Pedro Arrupe, SJ).</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p><p>(Reviewed September 2023)</p></div>
